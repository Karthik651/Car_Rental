Database Description
The CarRentalDB database is structured to manage a car rental company’s operations efficiently. It enables tracking of customer records, car inventory, rental transactions, and invoice management with referential integrity. By using MySQL Server as the RDBMS, the database ensures reliable storage and access control. This setup supports business insights and data-driven decisions, such as identifying high-performing vehicles and tracking customer rental patterns.
